			<h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>Figuring out what can be done in css through javascript was challenging.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I had trouble getting the javascript applying the changes I wanted into the html.  I was also unsure what was meant by changing an html attribute to "say something new."</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>You currently bear witness to either my failure or sucess.</p>
