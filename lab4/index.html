	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p>We did not encounter many challenges throughout the completion of this lab.</p>
	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p>Problems only arose when we tried to type pseudocode in Atom.  The font color used in commented out code for javascript is allmost identical to the background color, so we had to type the pseudocode in Google Docs.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p>We completed the lab on time and with minimal difficulty.</p>
